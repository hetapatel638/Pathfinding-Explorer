# Pathfinding Visualizer

The Pathfinding Visualizer is a tool I created to visualize pathfinding algorithms in action. My fascination with these algorithms led me to develop this application, and I hope that you enjoy exploring and experimenting with it as much as I enjoyed creating it. You can access it here (use Google Chrome!):https://hetapatel638.github.io/Pathfinding-Explorer/ 

## Meet the Algorithms

Pathfinding Visualizer is an application that allows users to visualize various pathfinding algorithms in action.
The following algorithms are supported:
  * Dijkstra's Algorithm (weighted)
  * A* Search (weighted)
  * Greedy Best-first Search (weighted)
  * Swarm Algorithm (weighted)
  * Convergent Swarm Algorithm (weighted)
  * Bidirectional Swarm Algorithm (weighted)
  * Breath-first Search (unweighted)
  * Depth-first Search (unweighted)

## Additionally, 
* Dijkstra's Algorithm is known as the "father" of pathfinding algorithms and guarantees the shortest path.
* A* Search uses heuristics to guarantee the shortest path much faster than Dijkstra's Algorithm.
* Greedy Best-first Search is a faster, more heuristic-heavy version of A* but does not guarantee the shortest path.
* The Swarm Algorithm is a mixture of Dijkstra's Algorithm and A* Search and does not guarantee the shortest path.
* The Convergent Swarm Algorithm is a faster, more heuristic-heavy version of Swarm and does not guarantee the shortest path.
* The Bidirectional Swarm Algorithm explores Swarm from both sides and does not guarantee the shortest path.
* Breath-first Search is a great algorithm that guarantees the shortest path.
* Depth-first Search is a poor algorithm for pathfinding and does not guarantee the shortest path.
